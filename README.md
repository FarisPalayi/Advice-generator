## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a simple straightforward project to make. Instead of learning new things, in this project my focus was to use the things that I already knew.

Though, I did learn one new Git command. This command can be used to clean up unreachable or "orphaned" Git objects or to delete the obsolete tracking objects in Git.

```
git fetch --all --prune
```
